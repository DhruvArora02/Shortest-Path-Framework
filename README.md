# dijkstra_implementation
The project encompasses the design and implementation of a comprehensive graph data structure along with additional functionality for shortest path calculations. The core structure, represented by the `BaseGraph` class, enables the storage of nodes and directed weighted edges, while the `DijkstraGraph` class extends it by integrating Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. The latter class offers methods to compute the shortest path between nodes and retrieve both the path's data and cost. Complementing these classes is the `GraphADT` interface, which defines the contract for a directed graph with positive edge weights and outlines methods for node and edge manipulation, as well as shortest path computations. This project provides a solid foundation for constructing, managing, and analyzing directed graphs within a variety of applications.
